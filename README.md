The site includes an "About Me" section where the visitor will find a picture of myself as well as a small blurb describing myself as a software developer, a "Contact" section, a "Portfolio" section in which to view six of my coding projects, and a "Resume" section where they can find a link to my downloadable resume along with my technical proficiencies.
