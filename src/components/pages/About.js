      Full-stack web developer leveraging a sociology and finance background to build purposeful web applications. I recently earned a certificate in full stack development from UC Berkeley Extensionâ€™s Coding Bootcamp with skills in full-stack technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and back-end run-time environments like Node.js. I am passionate about building impactful web applications whilst focusing on mobile-first design and development. Establishing a meaningful user-impact is very important to me in every project I set out to complete. My goal is to identify current pitfalls in our society and to create web applications that tactfully address these issues. I believe in the implementation of the agile methodology and have utilized it in a recent collaborative project. I aim to utilize my technical skills, as well as my abilities to work well in groups, conduct thorough research, and collaboratively problem-solve, while working with a quality-driven team whose mission it is to create a better UX on the web.
